# Grocery-Store-Project:

Abstract/Motivation â€“ This paper describes my project report that we as team worked to 
build for our Database management system course. The reason we choose retail application 
for my project is because we know these days everyone thinks delivered to their home 
instead of going out to shop for. I personally most of the time opt for picking up grocery 
from Walmart, that not only save me time but also help me not to go inside the store and 
search for item in every shelf.

# Introduction: 
This is the project report from my Fall 2022 experience on working on an retail grocery 
application project mainly working as an student to try to learn the concepts of the database 
management, from the basics like inserting or deleting the data from the table to creating my 
own design for database and reducing my tables using normalization.
To accomplish my task in this project and to make look my application user friendly and smooth 
running I am going to use PostgreSQL along with JAVASCRIPT GUI, the reason I choose 
JavaScript over any other language is, firstly, I am very familiar with JavaScript and its libraries 
and it my preferred language for coding. Graphical user interface (GUI) supported by JavaScript, 
is like no other and creating the non-web-based application using JavaScript GUI is the best I 
found. For managing my database, I choose PostgreSQL server, the reason I choose that is 
because it little easy to write on, user friendly and besides that many tech companies uses 
PostgreSQL.

# Contribution:
We as team who are still the learner of the database management concept, so we were very clear 
since the beginning that we both get to do equal part, and we both work not only to complete the 
project but also to learn a lot from it.
For the design of database I (Aditya) and my teammate Milin worked together to design our 
database, and what table to add, and deciding on primary keys and foreign keys. 
Connection between JavaScript eclipse and PostgreSQL was completed by Aditya.
For coding in JavaScript and designing queries for tables we divided our work in equal half so 
that both of us can be able to write code in JavaScript as well design the queries for our own part 
of the JavaScript code.
However, initial idea for the user interface design was given by Aditya and the final report was 
prepared by me.
And for presentation too we try to divide work equally.
At the end I can say both of us worked as team leaders to push each other to the limit and being 
mentors for each other
